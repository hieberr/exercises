/* # Objective
 To create an example of the Prototype Pattern
 
 The prototype Design pattern should be used when you need to create new objects that are cheaper to clone, than to create via new() and then setting its member values.
 
 Generally you create an abstract class which includes a clone() method.  One or more classes implement this abstract class and a client instantiates the first one (or a singleton holds the prototype), and makes clones when more are needed.
 
 The prototype pattern can be used in conjuction with the abstract factory pattern .
 The prototype pattern can use a singleton to hold the initial prototype from which others are cloned.
 Design patterns that make heavy use of composite and decorator patterns can benefit from the prototype pattern as well.
 Rule of thumb: clone an object when you want to create another object at runtime that is a true copy of the object you are cloning. For example, if you had an Account object that you wanted to clone, modify slightly, and then replace the original object with the updated Account object.
