/* # Singleton
 ## Objective
Implement a threadsafe Singleton in Swift. It turns out this is easy since static members are initialized atomically in Swift.

    // In Swift 'static' (class) memebers are initized lazily, and with dispatch_once so that it is thread safe.

// ## Usage:
Singleton.instance.doSomething()
