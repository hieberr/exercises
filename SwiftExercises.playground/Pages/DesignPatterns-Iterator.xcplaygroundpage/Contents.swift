 # Iterator Design Pattern
 ## Objective:
 Implement the Iterator Pattern
 
 #### Definition:
 ![Uml](IteratorUml.png)
 The iterator pattern is used to traverse and access a container of elements sequentially without knowing it's representation (e.g. the datastructure of the aggregate could be an array, a heap, a binary tree.. etc)
 
 - Define a seperate itorator object that encapsulates accessing and traversing an aggregate object.
