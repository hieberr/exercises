 # Visitor Design Pattern (Surrogate)
 ## Objective:
 Implement the Visitor Pattern
 
 #### Definition:
 ![Uml](VisitorUml.jpg)
 gof definition: Represent an operation to be performed on elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
 
 #### Use the visitor pattern when:
- many unrelated operations on an object structure are required,
- the classes that make up the object structure are known and not expected to change,
- new operations need to be added frequently,
- an algorithm involves several classes of the object structure, but it is desired to manage it in one single location,
- an algorithm needs to work across several independent class hierarchies.
 
 A drawback to this pattern, however, is that it makes extensions to the class hierarchy more difficult, as new classes typically require a new visit method to be added to each visitor.
