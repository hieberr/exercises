 ## Objective:
 Implement the abstract factory design pattern.

 #### Definition:
- Abstract Factory offers the interface for creating a family of related objects, without explicitly specifying their classes.
- Abstract factories are usually implemented using a set of factory methods.
 
 ![UML](AbstractFactoryUml.jpg)

 #### When to use this pattern:
- When you need to create families of products or you want to provide a library of products without exposing implementation details.
- From the GOF:
    “a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products”
 
    “you want to provide a class library of products, and you want to reveal just their interfaces, not their implementations”
 
 #### When not to use this pattern
- Use a simpler factory pattern if you can. e.g. If you only need several types of factory: use factory method. If you only need a single concrete factory: use a static factory.
- Don't create an abstract factory if you think you might need one later.  It's usually easy to refactor later than do the extra work up front and not need it.

 
 #### Difference from Factory Method:
- The main difference between a "factory method" and an "abstract factory" is that the factory method is a single method, and an abstract factory is an object. Because the factory method is just a method, it can be overridden in a subclass.
- The abstract factory pattern uses composition to delegate responsibility of creating object to another class while factory method pattern uses inheritance and relies on a derived class or sub class to create object.

 ## Example
 This example defines a layout factory for user interface elements. The example includes two factories that build UiElements that look/behave differently (in theory).

 #### Usage
  In this example we create a metalUi with a window and a button, destroy it, and then create a flat ui window and button.

var button: UixButton = uiFactory.getButton()
var window: UixWindow = uiFactory.getWindow()
button.display()
window.display()
uiFactory.destroyUi()

// Switch the factory to a Flat factory which makes Flat style Ui elements
uiFactory = FlatUiFactory()
button = uiFactory.getButton()
window = uiFactory.getWindow()

//display the new UI
button.display()
window.display()

 /*
