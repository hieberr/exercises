 # Facade Design pattern
 ## Objective:
 Implement Facade
 
 #### Definition:
 - A facade object provides a simplified interface to a more complex body of code such as a class library.

 #### Solves problems like:
 - You need a simple interface to access a complex system. Because the system is more complex than you need, or maybe it is poorly designed and can't be changed.
 - An entry point is needed to each level of layered software
 - The abstractions and implementations of a subsystem are tightly coupled.
 
 
 #### Adapter vs decorator vs facade vs bridge
 - An adapter can be used when the wrapper must respect a particular interface. Converts one interface into another so that it matches what the client is expecting.
 - A decorator makes it possible to add or alter behavior of an interface at run-time.
 - A facade is used when an easier or simpler interface to an underlying object is desired.  Use a facade to simpliy an interface.
 - Adapter makes things work after they're designed; Bridge makes them work before they are.
 - Bridge is designed up-front to let the abstraction and the implementation vary independently.  Adapter is retrofitted to make unrelated classes work together.
