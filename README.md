# exercises
I try to do daily, or nearly daily programming exercises and demos to improve my skills. The more complex demos go into the Swift-Sandbox repository. The simpler exercises go here. I try to keep the exercises to a single file, with comments, explanation and sample output. Most of these are XCode playgrounds.
